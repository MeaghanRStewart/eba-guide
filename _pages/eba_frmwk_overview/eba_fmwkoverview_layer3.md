###Establishing Our New Architectural Foundation (Dark Blue)

This layer is where we fuse the traditional domains from enterprise architecture (TOGAF) and the technology enablers (five pillars) with the future state service needs of our citizens. A matrix is used where the intersection of an EA domain and a pillar informs the service owner of how a technology can empower them to meet their service transformation goals. For example, the intersection between the digital pillar and application architecture focuses on channel integration. In other words, as a service moves to the digital world, application design must consider how it interacts across all channels including in person, call-centre, mobile, and digital and be sure that they produce consistent results regardless of choice by the citizen.

*Note: While this layer is framed by technology enablers, its principles remain focused on service design and delivery. While the technology is important, it is critical that the EBA framework demonstrate to service owners’ how using a particular technology will help them meet their service goals and objectives. An example would be the intersection between the cloud pillar and data architecture. While cloud technology and data integration are important to understand when designing a service, the rationale for leveraging this technology is all about the portability of citizen data when and where they need it and so they don’t have to keep entering their information for each transaction.*
