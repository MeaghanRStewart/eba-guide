### Defining the Business Environment (Green)

This layer translates the strategic intent of government into a set of future state service needs. First, based on an aggregation of government strategies, the document establishes a set of service themes that have been identified as critical path initiatives for the next five years. It is important to note that this list is based on themes and not individual projects. The reason for this is that, from the analysis of the strategy documents, it became apparent that many sectors have similar underlying business needs that can best be resolved by tackling the issues from an enterprise perspective.

The second layer introduces the service design patterns we believe best describe the building blocks behind many government services. To be clear, not all services require all service design patterns; rather, their value comes from their ability for service owners to identify modular and repeatable components that aggregate into the service they need to deliver. This approach creates better outcomes for citizens by producing a consistent experience across program areas. For example, when a citizen needs to pay government for a service, they are not met with different processes and tasks each time. Leveraging service patterns also provides value to government by presenting a standardized set of capabilities that reduces the resources required to implement their initiative. Going back to the pay government example, rather than re-invent the wheel and design their own payment process, service owners can look to the service pattern and know that using it will expedite the delivery of their initiative and produce a more efficient and consistent service experience.

The final layer of this section is where the EBA framework starts to delve into the traditional architecture domains by laying out a set of business architecture principles that underpin the government’s overall business architecture. These tenets reflect an agreed upon set of common service architectures that should be considered when modifying or designing new government services. It is also the intersection point between business intent and technology enablement as we begin to organize the stated business principles around the OCIO’s five pillars. For example, the first principle of this layer discusses the need for blended choice across delivery channels. It is aligned with the mobility pillar because we want to stress the importance of, at a minimum, considering the applicability of a mobile channel as part of a service.
