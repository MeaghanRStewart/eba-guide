The final layer of the EBA framework is included to identify the common services that are available to service owners. Common services are cross-government business enablers that provide value to both the citizen and government. For the citizen, using common services means they will come to know what to expect when interacting with government regardless of the service they need. For government, using a common service will reduce the effort required to plan, build, and run a service. A prime example is Pay BC as it brings a standardized payment platform available to all government services.
