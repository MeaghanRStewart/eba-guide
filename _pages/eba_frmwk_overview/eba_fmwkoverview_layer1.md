Aligning to Our Business Context (Light Blue)

The top layer establishes the strategic drivers that influence and inform the rest of the EBA. First, we include the three overarching strategies that most affect our stakeholder groups. It is the goals of these three documents that collectively define the governmentâ€™s business landscape and become our beacon for business alignment by the other architecture domains. From these strategies come the sector responses in the form of actions and initiatives that ministries believe will support the goals and outcomes of government. The artifacts used to establish the context for this layer include IMIT capital planning submissions, service plans, and the many line of business action plans.
