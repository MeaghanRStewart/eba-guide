title: EBA Principles
---
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In creating this document, the Architecture, Standards, and Planning Branch (ASPB) adopted a set of principles to guide how the document was structured and to determine the themes that influence the content at each layer. The principles used to build the EBA are:

1.  The EBA framework is about alignment and enablement. It is designed to produce a record of key business and technology decisions that government has made in order to create a cohesive corporate direction and to support the activities of service transformation

2.  The EBA must be valuable to our stakeholders - this means that it becomes an important business tool that produces better investment decision making and more impactful services

3.  “Just Enough Architecture” is always the right amount. The EBA is modular by design, allowing stakeholders to pick and choose the components that are the best fit for their initiative

4.  The documents are transitional and future looking. Their primary purpose is to create a picture of the proposed future state and highlight specific actions and technologies required to get there

5.  The tone and content of the EBA is deliberately thought provoking and aspirational. The expectation is that the document will act as a catalyst for more in depth conversations leading to new and innovative ways of delivering services

6.  It is a living document and will be reviewed quarterly and updated bi-annually. The pace of change in business and technology innovation means we must regularly review the EBA for relevancy
