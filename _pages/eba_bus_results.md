title: Using the EBA for Business Results
---

This section explains *when* the EBA should be used and *how* to leverage the content to make better business decisions and design services. For the *when*, the EBA references the initiative lifecycle, which is a high-level series of steps that constitute the service design process. The EBA framework contributes throughout the lifecycle as service owners can regularly check back with the document to see if their initiative remains in-step with government direction. For the *how*, the EBA walks through the *EBA* alignment process whereby an initiative measures its alignment against the tenets at each layer of the EBA to come up with an alignment “score”. The higher the score, the stronger the alignment which, in turn, will work to identify investments that are in the best interests of both government and citizens.

> *Note: The ASPB will be introducing an EBA scoring system to measure alignment by government initiatives.*

##EBA and the Initiative Lifecycle

The initiative lifecycle is a basic framework that highlights the steps a new service will take starting from the initial concept or need and finishing when the service “hits the market” and is available for use.

To answer the question “when to use the EBA?” the case can be made to use it throughout the lifecycle. At all points along the journey, it will help answer questions such as:

* Is this a service that citizens want?

* Should government invest in this service?

* Does it align with government’s goals and objectives?

* Are we building this right?

* Do we have the resources to execute?

* Does this service have value across government?

The following lists the ways in which the framework provides guidance and validation at each phase:
