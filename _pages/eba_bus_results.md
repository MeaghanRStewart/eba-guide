title: Using the EBA for Business Results
---

This section explains *when* the EBA should be used and *how* to leverage the content to make better business decisions and design services. For the *when*, the EBA references the initiative lifecycle, which is a high-level series of steps that constitute the service design process. The EBA framework contributes throughout the lifecycle as service owners can regularly check back with the document to see if their initiative remains in-step with government direction. For the *how*, the EBA walks through the *EBA* alignment process whereby an initiative measures its alignment against the tenets at each layer of the EBA to come up with an alignment “score”. The higher the score, the stronger the alignment which, in turn, will work to identify investments that are in the best interests of both government and citizens.

> *Note: The ASPB will be introducing an EBA scoring system to measure alignment by government initiatives.*
