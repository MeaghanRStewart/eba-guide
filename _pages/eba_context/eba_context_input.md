At the top of the diagram are the EBA inputs that are derived from the government’s strategic intent, business priorities and key organizations shaping the direction of digital transformation. This includes:

* Ministry business, strategic, and service plans
* Government strategies such as Citizens at the Centre, and 
* Directives and guidance from senior government bodies, such as the Deputy Minister’s Council on Transformation and Technology (DMCTT)

A review of these documents was completed, which uncovered a set of critical business and technology enablers that government will need to acquire over the next three to five years if transformation is to be successful.  The following outlines specifically how the EBA inputs were used to create the various sections within the framework:

* The inputs were first used to populate the top two sections of the EBA framework. These sections set the strategic context for transformation decisions (light blue) and establish a common business environment for government (green)

* The inputs were then meshed with the OCIO Strategy and the standard enterprise architecture domains to establish a set of IMIT enablers that support the strategic and business environments (dark blue)

> *Note: TOGAF is the government’s de facto Enterprise Architecture Framework. The standard enterprise architecture domains are a) Business, b) Data, c) Application, d) Technology, and e) Security*

* The final use for the inputs is to identify common business and technology themes that could either leverage an existing service or be used to justify the creation of new ones (orange)

With the EBA Framework in place, the next step is to identify a) a set technology enablers that would help the builders of government solutions align with the EBA, and b) key business processes and activities that would benefit from using the EBA as an input when making decisions about service design.
