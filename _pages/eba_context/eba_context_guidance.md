###Common Services and Design Patterns  

In an effort to bring consistency to the citizen experience and reduce costs for government, the EBA advocates for the use and/or creation of common services. Common services are enterprise focused and produce a standardized set of capabilities that can be leveraged across government regardless of the line of business it supports. An example of a common service is payment, either to or by government. Within each common service there is a set of standard design patterns, which are building blocks that aggregate to create a service. Service design patterns bring value by establishing a consistent way that a repeated activity, such as paying government, is designed, built and executed.

###IMIT Capital Planning  

The EBA should provide both a reference point and measuring stick for IMIT capital submissions.  First, plans should have strong alignment with the strategic and business context of government as outlined in the EBA. This helps answer the “why” government should undertake an initiative. Second, the submission should measure its proposed solution against the stated IMIT direction found in the EBA. This helps answer “how” the innovative will leverage technology to create a solution. A successful IMIT capital submission should have strong alignment to both the business and technology principles in the EBA.

###Ministry Projects  

The EBA should perform the same function for ministry projects as it does for the IMIT capital planning process. There should be strong, measurable alignment between the project and the business and technology enablers outlined in the EBA.
