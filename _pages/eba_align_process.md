title: The EBA Alignment Process
---
------------------------------------------------------------------

The other big question around the value of the EBA can be demonstrated by what we are calling the EBA alignment process. This process is designed to take an initiative/project and “score” it vis-à-vis its alignment to the various domains of the EBA. For the purpose of this example, scoring takes the form of lighting up boxes on the framework itself. The more boxes that are lit up the greater the alignment. In the future, there will be an EBA alignment checklist that stakeholders can use to assess their initiative/project aligns with corporate direction.

##Steps and Purpose:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

###Business Inputs and Outcomes

Alignment at this step is all about identifying the business context and service outcomes of a particular initiative. Using documents such as service plans, IMIT Capital submissions, and project plans we begin to collect intelligence on the rationale for a proposed solution and the value it will deliver. With respect to the business context, it is critical to understand the types of services an organization delivers, how they do so today, and what is their future direction. In terms of outcomes, we use this step to uncover what the initiative hopes to achieve, the capabilities it will need to execute, and if the proposed solution will in fact produce the stated outcomes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

###Strategic Alignment

The layer is used to gauge alignment with government’s key strategy documents (BC Technology Strategy, Citizen @ the Centre, Being the Best 2.0) and their related principles or goals. For example, if the initiative’s solution is citizen facing, we would reference Citizen @ the Centre and assess if it aligns with “saving citizens’ time in their interaction with government and making it easier to access better quality services?” If it does, the initiative would receive alignment points                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

###Business Alignment

This step is used to evaluate alignment with the government’s current business environment. Alignment is measured at three levels:

* First, there is an assessment of the alignment with the future state service needs of government. This is a list of service “themes” gleaned out the various plans from across government that show the types of services that are going to be developed. Alignment here is to see if the proposal matches up with the types of services deemed important to government 

* Second, there is an evaluation vis-à-vis the government’s service patterns. Service patterns are the business building blocks that describe what government does. Alignment here will demonstrate that the initiative is in concert with the types of activities citizens expect government to deliver 

* Finally, alignment is gauged against the framework’s business architecture principles. This layer describes foundational tenets that guide the way government wants to transform its services. Alignment here is to measure the level at which the initiative has embraced these principles as reflected by the proposed solution 

###Pillars

At this point, the EBA starts to measure the alignment of an initiative against technology enablers. This layer specifically measures the alignment with the five pillars outlined in the OCIO Strategy. The purpose of the pillars is to establish a set of high-level set directives for the future looking technologies expected to influence the way government designs and delivers services. Alignment for this layer will be measured against the inclusion of the five pillars as part of the solution. By no means must a service leverage the 5 pillars; however, given that this is the stated direction of the OCIO, there may be a need to rationalize their exclusion from the solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

###Architecture Alignment

Alignment at this layer is measured against the four remaining architecture domains: 

* data
* application
* technology
* security

**Data**: Is it open, integrated across services, and available for service measurement and analytics?

**Application**: Does the solution design follow user experience principles, integrate across service channels, and incorporate mobile devices?

**Technology**: Does the technology selected give citizens and employees choice, reflect the technology they use in their everyday life, and enable service delivery even in remote locations. 

**Security**: Is the citizen or employee confident that their information and digital identify is safe even in the cloud, are data security and privacy mechanisms explicitly identified in the solution, and are the concerns of citizens and employees reflected in the security design of the service?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

###Common Services

The alignment exercise at this layer is to evaluate an initiative’s potential use of corporate common services. Leveraging common services is seen as crucial to building a consistent citizen service experience across programs and driving down the cost of service delivery for government. For example, if a new service either collects money on behalf of government or pays money to citizens, there needs to be an assessment on the feasibility of using PayBC as its payment broker. Again, an initiative is not mandated to use the bundle of common services but it will be required to make a strong case as to why it does not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

###Recommendations

The final step in the process is to provide the initiative with an assessment of its alignment with the EBA and recommendations for next steps. First, it gives an overall assessment of the alignment which highlights areas where it is strong and areas where there are gaps and opportunities for improvement. Next, the recommendations focus in on the specific principles that the initiative “lit up” during the course of the alignment exercise and provides further direction on how to incorporate them into the initiative and the value of doing so. Finally, it provides the initiative with a list of specific gaps where it is either: 

* In contradiction to the stated corporate direction in the EBA which would warrant more discussion with the service owner, or 
* Apparent that the solution is close to being in alignment with the EBA principles and with some assistance from ASPB can strengthen it alignment score
