title: The EBA Context
---

The second step to understanding the EBA is clearly defining the EBA context. To do this, the following section describes how the document was created, the business enablers that can benefit from aligning with the EBA principles, and the technology enablers required to support execution.

##Inputs: Strategic Intent and Business Priorities     
 
At the top of the diagram are the EBA inputs that are derived from the government’s strategic intent, business priorities and key organizations shaping the direction of digital transformation. This includes:

* a) ministry business, strategic, and service plans
* b) government strategies such as Citizens at the Centre, and 
* c) directives and guidance from senior government bodies, such as the Deputy Minister’s Council on Transformation and Technology (DMCTT)

A review of these documents was completed, which uncovered a set of critical business and technology enablers that government will need to acquire over the next three to five years if transformation is to be successful. The following outlines specifically how the EBA inputs were used to create the various sections within the framework:

* The inputs were first used to populate the top two sections of the EBA framework. These sections set the strategic context for transformation decisions (light blue) and establish a common business environment for government (green)

* The inputs were then meshed with the OCIO Strategy and the standard enterprise architecture domains to establish a set of IMIT enablers that support the strategic and business environments (dark blue)

> *Note: TOGAF is the government’s de facto Enterprise Architecture Framework. The standard enterprise architecture domains are a) Business, b) Data, c) Application, d) Technology, and e) Security*

* The final use for the inputs is to identify common business and technology themes that could either leverage an existing service or be used to justify the creation of new ones (orange)

With the EBA Framework in place, the next step is to identify a) a set technology enablers that would help the builders of government solutions align with the EBA, and b) key business processes and activities that would benefit from using the EBA as an input when making decisions about service design.

###IMIT Roadmaps   

IMIT roadmaps are plans that match the government’s strategic and operational goals with a release schedule of technology solutions and services. Roadmaps are valuable because:

* They help reach a consensus about the technologies required to meet business objectives
* They provide a mechanism to help forecast technology developments, and
* They provide a framework to help plan and prioritize technology investments

###Reference Architectures   

Reference architectures provide a comprehensive solution template for a technology within a specific domain, such as cloud computing. The value of reference architectures is their ability to aggregate, in a single model, the many concerns required to implement a solution, which includes business architecture, data architecture, technology architecture, security, policy and legislation, and governance. Our reference architectures will focus on the five pillars in the OCIO strategic plan.

###Technology Blueprints   

Technology blueprints are a lower level abstraction of reference architectures as they go into the specifics of the technology that the government will be implementing based on the schedule from the roadmaps. The value of blueprints is their ability to provide a clear list of technologies that our partners can expect to be available when planning out their initiatives.

###Enterprise IMIT Standards 
 
IMIT standards bring consistency, interoperability, and economies of scale to the enablement of digital services. The value of having standards is that they provide a common language and an agreed upon set of IMIT decisions designed to ensure compatibility between systems, devices, and vendors. In the government context, they also support compliance with government policies and legislation such as privacy and the protection of personal information.

##Guidance: Business Enablers

###Common Services and Design Patterns  

In an effort to bring consistency to the citizen experience and reduce costs for government, the EBA advocates for the use and/or creation of common services. Common services are enterprise focused and produce a standardized set of capabilities that can be leveraged across government regardless of the line of business it supports. An example of a common service is payment, either to or by government. Within each common service there is a set of standard design patterns, which are building blocks that aggregate to create a service. Service design patterns bring value by establishing a consistent way that a repeated activity, such as paying government, is designed, built and executed.

###IMIT Capital Planning  

The EBA should provide both a reference point and measuring stick for IMIT capital submissions.  First, plans should have strong alignment with the strategic and business context of government as outlined in the EBA. This helps answer the “why” government should undertake an initiative. Second, the submission should measure its proposed solution against the stated IMIT direction found in the EBA. This helps answer “how” the innovative will leverage technology to create a solution. A successful IMIT capital submission should have strong alignment to both the business and technology principles in the EBA.

###Ministry Projects  

The EBA should perform the same function for ministry projects as it does for the IMIT capital planning process. There should be strong, measurable alignment between the project and the business and technology enablers outlined in the EBA.
