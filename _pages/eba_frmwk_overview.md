title: The EBA Framework
---

The EBA framework is a visual representation of the request made by DMCTT for an enterprise business architecture. Taking a top-down, modular approach, the framework presents the high-level relationship between government strategy, service delivery context, and technology enablement. The top two layers (light blue and green) are all about strategy and business intent as they define the business components of the ecosystem. Their focus is to give clarity to what we do and what citizens expect us to deliver. The bottom two layers (dark blue and orange) focus on future state technology and ideas for cross-government enablers via common services.
