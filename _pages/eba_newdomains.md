title: EBA & the New Solution Domains
---

The first thing to understand about the EBA is that it does not exist in a vacuum; rather, it is one component in a larger ecosystem contributing to a shift in the way government builds services. A set of new solution domains have been identified that will move government forward more rapidly and efficiently on its transformation journey. Work is underway across all domains in an effort to introduce a whole of government approach to providing solutions whereby service owners leverage a series of corporate guides to tackle their immediate business issues. These guides will provide a set of repeatable building actions that reduce the effort, time, and money required to build or enhance services. The EBA is one of these guides. The following diagram outlines the new domains for business solution design:

##Domain & Impact on Service Transformation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

###Service Design                        

Service design is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication and material components of a service in order to improve its quality and the interaction between service provider and in our case citizens [https://www.service-design-network.org/manifesto]. Government has made a concerted effort to incorporate service design principles, especially those related to citizen engagement, into our initiatives. *The Service Design Guide* is the blueprint for this domain. The impact of service design on transformation is the creation of services truly for citizens by citizens as opposed to those government think they want and most often deliver.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
###Enterprise Business Architecture     

EBA is a description of the structure and interaction between the business strategy, organization, functions, business processes, and information needs. The impact of EBA on service transformation is the creation of a corporately agreed upon set of business and technology building blocks that are readily available to service owners across government. These building blocks will bring clarity to the needs of citizens, strategic intent of government, and technology enablers required to deliver high quality government services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

###Collaborative Application Development     

Collaborative Application development changes the way government has traditionally done application development in two ways:

	* First, it puts the needs of the citizen front and centre by including them throughout the creation process, giving them multiple opportunities to provide feedback on the product to be delivered 
	* Second, it looks to collaboration amongst developers in the form of self-organizing teams to plan, debate, and produce solutions

The BC Developers’ Exchange is government’s first attempt at building out this capacity. The impact of collaborative application design on service transformation will be a far better product both in terms of meeting the needs of citizens and bringing a more agile approach to application development                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

###Enterprise Integration     

Enterprise integration focuses on the way government finds creative and innovative ways to leverage the shift to cloud computing. For this shift to be successful, we must make a concerted effort to leverage a cloud-based enterprise integration platform. The platform must link the people, process, data, and technology horizontally in line with citizen need irrespective of traditional ministry boundaries. The work underway at CloudBC, BC’s Cloud Service Integrator, will be instrumental in laying the foundation for enterprise integration in the province. The impact of enterprise integration means government can create services that are bundled and personalized as citizen information will travel with them so they have it when they need it. It will also mean new choices for interacting with government, especially in the mobility space.                                                                                                    

###Common Services     

The evolution of common services centres for the creation of enterprise-level programs, policies, processes, and technologies would enable a consistent experience across services. For example, a common pay platform whereby citizens would experience the same level of service whether buying a government licence, paying their taxes, or purchasing government services. 

The job of the service owner would also be made easier as they would have access to ready-made services that they could incorporate into their business solutions, reducing effort, time and money. The impact of common services on service transformation will be twofold: 

* Government will be better able to respond to the modern service needs of citizens through the availability of standardized enterprise services
* There will be reduced to government as common services bring repeatability, consistency, and reduced cost to the delivery of the specific services they provide

###Lean     

The tools and practices associated with the government’s adoption of [Lean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean\_Six\_Sigma) is a critical enabler across all the aforementioned business solution domains. As government modernizes and transforms its services, it must not simply move existing processes to the digital ecosystem. Rather, as part of an overall redesign effort, a lean exercise should be applied holistically across services to reduce waste, red tape, and streamline execution so that every step that the citizen and employee undertake provides value. The impact of lean on service transformation will be the creation of services that truly align with the needs of citizens while empowering employees to be more efficient and get more done with less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

###Agile
     
Government must also change the way it develops applications as the traditional approach to system design has proven to be unwieldy and unresponsive. Agile, and its philosophies around continuous iterative delivery, self-forming teams, and high levels of collaboration, is the second critical enabler to the new business solution domains. Instead of the waterfall approach, whereby solutions are delivered in a linear fashion with little visibility into the product until the time of delivery, agile promotes development in a continuous manner relying on significant customer feedback throughout and delivering a series of small incremental products. The impact of agile on service transformation will be the increased speed and accuracy at which government can respond to the service needs of our citizens.
