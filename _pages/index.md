Title: Introduction

The Deputy Minister’s Council for Transformation and Technology (DMCTT) asked the Government Chief Information Officer to produce an Enterprise Business Architecture (EBA) for use as a reference point when assessing the alignment between the needs of our citizens, the Province’s strategic business objectives, and our long-term IMIT investments. Specifically, the EBA was asked to deliver:

1.  A record of collective EBA decisions that government has made to support the execution of its strategic directives and service transformation

2.  A unifying business and IMIT framework that strengthens corporate decision making and reduces risk when making investments in digital services

3.  An understanding of the relationship between the government’s strategic intent, the modern service needs of our citizens, and the technology required to enable the path forward

4.  A roadmap for ministries and related government bodies to use when planning future initiatives from both business and technical perspectives

5.  A proposed future state for government services based on identified business needs and required technical capabilities

The *Enterprise Business Architecture for the Government of British Columbia* is the response to this request. It is designed to be a government “blueprint” outlining an agreed upon set of business and technology principles that helps:

* shape the design and creation of modern government services
* set corporate direction and funding priorities for IMIT investments
* enable government to implement business and technology solutions that truly meet the needs and expectations of our citizens. 

The cornerstone of this document is what we are calling the *EBA Framework,* which is the visual representation of the tenets we believe reflect the future-state business and technology needs required to transform government service delivery.

The EBA has not taken a traditional approach to defining the government’s business architecture. This is because we looked at what was already available in the EBA space and found most documents to be either:

* academic in nature and not consumable by government service owners-our target audience, or
* technology architectures disguised as business architectures, which again would provide little value to our stakeholders. 

Instead, it was decided to take a “fusion” approach to EBA whereby we would combine many of the traditional building blocks from the enterprise architecture discipline ([TOGAF](TOGAF: http://www.opengroup.org/)) with the strategic intent of the BC Government and infuse them both with the future state service needs of our citizens. The end result being a document that speaks to the needs of service owners within the BC Government by giving them a guide for architecting the modern services British Columbian’s expect.

Finally, it is critical that *The Enterprise Business Architecture for the Government of British Columbia* exists as a living document as it must be updated on a regular basis to reflect the rapidly evolving business and technology needs of government services. Included below is the bi-annual refresh schedule complete with quarterly milestones that ASPB will work to in an effort to keep the document current and relevant to those who will look to it for guidance.
