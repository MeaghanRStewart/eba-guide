This guide is a key deliverable produced under the IT Product and Service Design Initiative being executed by Technology Solutions (TS) within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) at the Ministry of Technology, Innovation and Citizens’ Services (MTICS).

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Deputy Minister’s Council for Transformation and Technology (DMCTT) asked the Government Chief Information Officer to produce an Enterprise Business Architecture (EBA) for use as a reference point when assessing the alignment between the needs of our citizens, the Province’s strategic business objectives, and our long-term IMIT investments. Specifically, the EBA was asked to deliver:

1.  A record of collective EBA decisions that government has made to support the execution of its strategic directives and service transformation

2.  A unifying business and IMIT framework that strengthens corporate decision making and reduces risk when making investments in digital services

3.  An understanding of the relationship between the government’s strategic intent, the modern service needs of our citizens, and the technology required to enable the path forward

4.  A roadmap for ministries and related government bodies to use when planning future initiatives from both business and technical perspectives

5.  A proposed future state for government services based on identified business needs and required technical capabilities

The *Enterprise Business Architecture for the Government of British Columbia* is the response to this request. It is designed to be a government “blueprint” outlining an agreed upon set of business and technology principles that helps:

* shape the design and creation of modern government services
* set corporate direction and funding priorities for IMIT investments
* enable government to implement business and technology solutions that truly meet the needs and expectations of our citizens. 

The cornerstone of this document is what we are calling the *EBA Framework,* which is the visual representation of the tenets we believe reflect the future-state business and technology needs required to transform government service delivery.

The EBA has not taken a traditional approach to defining the government’s business architecture. This is because we looked at what was already available in the EBA space and found most documents to be either:

* academic in nature and not consumable by government service owners-our target audience, or
* technology architectures disguised as business architectures, which again would provide little value to our stakeholders. 

Instead, it was decided to take a “fusion” approach to EBA whereby we would combine many of the traditional building blocks from the enterprise architecture discipline ([TOGAF](TOGAF: http://www.opengroup.org/)) with the strategic intent of the BC Government and infuse them both with the future state service needs of our citizens. The end result being a document that speaks to the needs of service owners within the BC Government by giving them a guide for architecting the modern services British Columbian’s expect.

Finally, it is critical that *The Enterprise Business Architecture for the Government of British Columbia* exists as a living document as it must be updated on a regular basis to reflect the rapidly evolving business and technology needs of government services. Included below is the bi-annual refresh schedule complete with quarterly milestones that ASPB will work to in an effort to keep the document current and relevant to those who will look to it for guidance.

##Purpose
The purpose of this initiative is to enhance and build upon the previous good work already completed by TS staff in this space (for example, previous processes developed by Deloitte and TS Policy & Development). It ensures successful adoption across TS through effective change leadership, communications and engagement.

Included in this guide are:

* A maturity model to demonstrate a progression of desirable behaviours for IT product and service design and development across TS

* An IT Product and Service Design process map that visually depicts how new products and services will be designed and developed using a range of traditional and/or multi-modal approaches

* Simple explanations of each step in the process, including inputs, outputs and checkpoints

* A governance framework to guide new behaviour and establish key roles and responsibilities

* Recommendations on how to communicate the enhanced IT Product and Service Design process and encourage sustainable adoption across TS

* Recommendations on how to automate the IT product and service design process in the future

This guide will provide the means to change behaviour, leading to sustained operationalization and enhanced IT product and service design process for TS. It will also serve as a communication tool to increase awareness and adoption of the enhanced process.

##Context

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/3Qs_BlueRectangle.png" alt="Blue Rectangle"> 

Driving this initiative is the shared recognition that we need to better understand, anticipate, and manage ministry and broader public sector demand for new IT products and services. We need to align investment decisions with business value to ensure investments are made in the right products and services, and to ensure that we have the right resources to sustain an appropriate portfolio of IT projects. We must change our own product and service delivery behaviour via the adoption of an enhanced-yet-simplified IT product and service design process that crosses all TS service lines. Overall, this more integrated approach aims to create business value for our clients, while reducing complexity and delivering excellent customer service.

In addition to the need for an enhanced IT product and service process, TS requires the introduction of both behavioural governance and structural governance, in an manner that is integrated with the overall process. Governance cannot be a standalone feature – it must be embedded within the process to ensure desired behaviours are reinforced and outcomes are achieved.

We are using an agile approach wherein iterative versions of this guide will be developed during two-week sprints, allowing us to “fail fast” and turn around quick improvements at a lower total cost. Our agile approach values individuals and interactions over tools and processes, and emphasizes collaboration with our customers.

#Target Audience

Users of this guide include any TS executive or TS staff member directly or indirectly involved in the ongoing design and development of IT products and services.

Additional stakeholders include:

* Ministry and broader public service partners
* The TS Executive Leadership Team
* Client Relations staff
* Service Delivery Units staff
* Other OCIO bodies (security, finance, others)
* Project Portfolio Management
* Service Management Branch
* The general public

##Assumptions

Development of this guide was based on the following assumptions:

* Reviewers have a working knowledge of the difference between, and complementary value of, traditional waterfall, agile and hybrid approaches to IT product and service design and development

* Users are comfortable with an iterative approach to the constant improvement of its content as our understanding of the requirements evolves through frequent trial and error

The guide is a living document that is updated regularly and informed by lessons learned along the way.
